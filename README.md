Kids grow very quickly, and thus parents have to spend a lot of money buying new toys while still
keeping the old ones. Also kids often like to play with different kinds of toys, and new collections of
toys are always coming to the market, and following that, kidsâ€™ preferences change frequently.
Implementing such an application would lead to parents saving a lot of money, having a much wider
choice of toys, and getting to meet new kids and their parents; this would be both helpful and
beneficial for the environment.
